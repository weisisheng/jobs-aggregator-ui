# jobs-aggregator-ui

This is a very simple NextJS (server-rendered React) UI to display searchable, aggregated job listings. You can find the website's API in another repo, jobs-aggregator-api. The crawler is private but I'll share that repo with you if you'd like to see it. This is live at https://www.eslbot.com.
